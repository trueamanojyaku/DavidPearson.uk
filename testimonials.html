  <h1 class="text-center display-2">Testimonials</h1>
  <br>
  <figure class="text-center">
    <p class="lead p-4">"David was my student both at undergrad and postgrad levels. He highly impressed me and other
      lecturers of the University of Wolverhampton by his intelligence, sociability and scholastic trend of mind. He
      always took a keen interest in his subject, was regular in attendance and diligent in his studies. He was liked by
      his lecturers as well as classmates because of his pleasing manners. He bears an excellent moral character and I
      wish him a successful career."<br><strong>Dr M Jackson (Senior Lecturer).</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="lead p-4">"I have known David since 2003. Initially as an employee and latterly as a loyal and trusted
      friend. David worked alongside me for fifteen years, in that time I cannot recall a single day lost for illness nor an
      incident of lateness. He was undoubtedly the most valuable member of my team. His work ethic is beyond reproach;
      his ability to assimilate and disseminate information is exceptional. Should I ever enter into Business again
      David would be my first employee. As a friend he is most supportive and I am proud to number him in the few true friends I have."
      <br><strong> Gary Oliver.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="lead p-4">"David was a joy to have around in class. He was very capable and keen to learn, but more
      importantly he was always curious and engaged. He often started conversations about the topics being covered, and
      inspired his peers to follow suit. I am sure he will be a very valuable asset to any project, and wish him all the
      best."<br><strong> Alix Bergeret (Senior Lecturer).</strong>
    </p>
    <!--
    <p class="lead p-4">"David was an invaluable member of the team. Highly motivated and keen to progress, he was
      regularly MVP. David was not only goal focused, but also sought to ensure that other elements of the team were
      upstanding and progressing. Indeed, David was instrumental in preventing the summoning of the Dunwich
      Horror."<br><strong> Dr Henry Armitage (Miskatonic University).</strong>
    </p>
    -->

    <p class="lead p-4">"I worked with David in what seems a lifetime ago, for what was only a short spell of 2 years in
      reality, but not only did working alongside David leave a lasting impression, but it gave me what I consider a
      friend for life. I can wholeheartedly say you will not find a more dedicated, considerate and willing to help
      employee or colleague that David Pearson.
      From my first week where he taught me the ropes on driver tachograph regulations, from his support 18 months in
      where he was always a phone call away, even when I relocated to a different branch, or even driving 30 miles out
      of his way to help me find an alternative route home when the motorway was shut.
      David has taken a different direction in his personal development and career journey, but I could not be more
      certain that his skillset, work ethic, and desire to help people will transfer into whatever journey he embarks on
      next."<br><strong> Rhys Donaldson Human Resources Manager at NWH Group.</strong>
